## The Task
> [!PDF|yellow] [[MCT333_Project_Competition_Description_Spring2026_v4 (1).pdf#page=5&selection=131,0,135,46&color=yellow|Core Challenge]]
> > Core Challenge: The run is split into two phases: (1) a Manual Teleoperation Phase for initial maneuvering, and (2) a fully Autonomous Phase where the robot must rely solely on onboard sensors and computation to pick up/place the box and detect its color.

> [!PDF|yellow] [[MCT333_Project_Competition_Description_Spring2026_v4 (1).pdf#page=7&selection=30,0,60,10&color=yellow|Safety Check]]
> > Pre-Competition Gate - Safety Check (Pass/Fail): the robot is inspected for wiring, sharp edges, mass, dimensions, fuse/protection, and PCB/electronics integrity. Failing teams must fix issues before competing.

**Interactive Zones**

> [!PDF|yellow] [[MCT333_Project_Competition_Description_Spring2026_v4 (1).pdf#page=6&selection=14,0,18,13&color=yellow|Elevated Pickup Stations]]
> > Pickup Stations: elevated pedestals (approx. 40 cm height) holding cubes with QR code encoding their color. Access is constrained to test omni-capabilities:

| **Zone**              | **Required Maneuver** | **Description**                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RED (Station A)**   | **Pure Y Move**       | You must approach the station straight-on and move purely forward/backward for final alignment before placing the cube. |
| **BLUE (Station B)**  | **Pure X Move**       | You must face the station _parallel_ and strafe sideways (lateral movement) to place the cube.                          |
| **GREEN (Station C)** | **Rotation Station**  | You must align and then **rotate in place** to access and drop the cube.                                                |

### Project Requirements
> These are initial elements of the conceptual design
#### Functional
- Holonomic motion (using holonomic or omni-directional drive chain)
- Robotic arm with gripper (capable of lifting cubes from a ~40cm pedestal height and placing them into storage)
- Manual wireless teleportation
- Autonomous pick and place
- On-board storage bin/rack to hold 3 cubes simultaneously
- QR-code based color sorting
- Obstacle detection
- Repeatability
#### Modular
> [!PDF|yellow] [[MCT333_Project_Competition_Description_Spring2026_v4 (1).pdf#page=6&selection=84,12,90,16&color=yellow|Independence and Plug-and-Play Interface]]
> > base module and manipulator module must be independently testable and integrate via plug-and-play interfaces.
> 
- Mobile base
	- Control sub-module
	- Power sub-module
	- Wheel motor encoders (odometry) for distance/speed measurement and precise holonomic motion control for pure x and pure y maneuvers
	- IMU heading stabilization to prevent unintended rotation and improve accuracy in strafing and rotation-zone maneuvers.
- Manipulator
	- Control sub-module
	- Power sub-module
	- Vision system (camera) capable of reading QR code to define box color
- Easy of assembly and disassembly (standard mechanical interface)
	- Mounting pattern
	- Alignment features
- Easy of connection and disconnection (standard electrical interface)
	- Power connector
	- Communication connector
- Communication protocol
	- Define the method: CAN/UART/Ethernet/RS-485
	- Heartbeat
		- Active monitoring (e.g. if the Mobile Base (master) stops receiving a heartbeat from the Manipulator (slave), it assumes the module has crashed or disconnected)
		- System integrity: (e.g. a continuous "keep-alive" check, preventing the robot from attempting to execute commands when one of its modules is unresponsive)
	- Safety states
		![[MCT333_Project_Competition_Description_Spring2026_v4 (1).pdf#page=4&rect=59,360,517,514&color=yellow|MCT333_Project_Competition_Description_Spring2026_v4 (1), p.4]]
		- Emergency stop (e.g. disconnect power form all modules)
		- Failsafe mode (e.g. robot stops moving if it does not receive heartbeat and waits for manual intervention)
		- Transition points
- Optional sensors: proximity/ToF, depth camera, bump sensors, etc.

> [!note] Any open-source or reference designs used must be fully understood in terms of mechanical, electrical, and software considerations
